ACO
===

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Simulator for solution of the Travelling Salesman Problem in a space where all towns are connected.

Only the Ant-Cycle, Ant-Density and Ant-Quantity algorithms are implemented.

There is a future possibility of implementing other variants of (even completely different) algorithms (not all towns connected, etc.).

Written as a part of the Soft-Computing course at FIT BUT.
